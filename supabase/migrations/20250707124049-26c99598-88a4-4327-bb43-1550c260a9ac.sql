  'Welcome to Document Structure & Layout! üèóÔ∏è

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Create multi-section professional documents with consistent formatting, navigation tools, and proper layout structure for workplace readiness.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR INTERNS:
In your internship, you''ll create reports, proposals, and presentations that need to look professional and be easy to navigate. Employers expect documents with consistent formatting and clear structure.

GOOGLE DOCS VS. WORD:
If you''re used to Google Docs, Word offers much more powerful formatting tools! While Google Docs has basic headers and page breaks, Word gives you precise control over document sections, professional templates, and advanced navigation.

KEY CONCEPTS:

1. SECTION VS. PAGE BREAKS
- Page Break: Starts new page (think of it like pressing Enter many times)
- Section Break: Creates completely separate sections with different formatting
- Use Case: Different headers for each chapter, or mixing portrait/landscape pages

2. PAGE SETUP MASTERY
- Margins: Professional documents typically use 1" margins
- Orientation: Portrait for letters, Landscape for wide tables/charts
- Pro Tip: Always check margins before printing - saves paper and looks professional!

3. HEADERS & FOOTERS
- Headers: Company name, document title, date
- Footers: Page numbers, your name, file path
- Different first page: Title pages don''t need headers!

4. STYLES - YOUR FORMATTING SUPERPOWER
- Heading 1: Main sections (like chapter titles)
- Heading 2: Subsections 
- Normal: Body text
- Benefits: Click once to format, automatic Table of Contents, consistent look

5. NAVIGATION PANE
- Shows document outline
- Click headings to jump to sections
- Perfect for long documents!

HANDS-ON PROJECT: Create a Professional Internship Report
You''ll create a 4-section document:
- Title Page (no header/footer)
- Executive Summary (different header)
- Main Report (numbered pages)
- Appendix (different formatting)

ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES:
- Use proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Meaningful page numbers and section titles
- High contrast colors for visual clarity

PRACTICE TASKS:
1. Insert section breaks between document parts
2. Create different headers for each section
3. Apply consistent heading styles
4. Generate automatic page numbering
5. Use Navigation Pane to jump between sections

Remember: Consistency is key! Use styles instead of manual formatting every time.'

  'Welcome to Tables & Visuals! üìä‚ú®

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Design professional tables with calculations and integrate visuals (SmartArt, images, icons) that enhance document clarity and visual appeal.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR INTERNS:
Data presentation is crucial in any internship! Whether you''re creating budget reports, project timelines, or client presentations, well-designed tables and visuals make complex information easy to understand.

GOOGLE DOCS VS. WORD:
Word''s table tools are much more powerful than Google Docs! You get built-in calculations, advanced formatting options, and professional table styles that automatically adjust.

PROFESSIONAL TABLE DESIGN:

1. TABLE STRUCTURE BASICS
- Always include clear headers
- Use consistent alignment (numbers right-aligned, text left-aligned)
- Apply professional table styles for instant polish
- Keep data organized and easy to scan

2. TABLE CALCULATIONS
- SUM: Add up columns of numbers
- AVERAGE: Calculate averages automatically  
- COUNT: Count entries in a column
- Pro Tip: Tables can do basic math like Excel!

3. TABLE FORMATTING BEST PRACTICES
- Alternate row colors for readability
- Bold headers to separate from data
- Adjust column widths for content
- Use borders strategically (not every line needs a border!)

WORKING WITH VISUALS:

4. SMARTART FOR CONCEPTS
- Process diagrams: Show workflow steps
- Hierarchy charts: Organizational structures
- Cycle diagrams: Ongoing processes
- Perfect for making abstract concepts visual!

5. IMAGES & ICONS
- Professional photos only (no personal pics in work docs!)
- Icons for bullet points and emphasis
- Always include alt text for accessibility
- Compress images to keep file size manageable

6. TEXT WRAPPING MASTERY
- Square: Text flows around rectangular shape
- Tight: Text follows image outline
- Through: Text flows through transparent areas
- Behind Text: Image stays in background

MINI PROJECTS:

PROJECT A: Professional Resume Table
Create a skills table with:
- Skill categories
- Proficiency levels
- Years of experience
- Automatic calculations

PROJECT B: Visual Process Guide
Design a how-to guide with:
- SmartArt process flow
- Supporting images with proper wrapping
- Professional table for reference data

ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Alt text for all images (describe what''s shown)
- High contrast in tables
- Logical reading order for screen readers
- Meaningful table headers

PRACTICE CHALLENGES:
1. Create a budget table with SUM calculations
2. Insert and format a process SmartArt
3. Add images with proper text wrapping
4. Write descriptive alt text for visuals
5. Apply professional table styles

PRO TIPS FOR INTERNS:
- Save images separately before inserting (easier to update later)
- Use company brand colors if available
- Keep visuals relevant to your content
- When in doubt, ask your supervisor about visual guidelines!'

  'Welcome to References & Citations! üìöüîó

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Structure professional documents using Table of Contents, citations, footnotes, and cross-references to create credible, navigable documents.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR INTERNS:
In professional settings, you''ll often write reports that reference other sources, create proposals that need citations, or develop training materials that require structured navigation. These skills show attention to detail and academic rigor.

GOOGLE DOCS VS. WORD:
While Google Docs has basic citation tools, Word offers comprehensive academic formatting with automatic bibliography generation, advanced cross-referencing, and professional TOC creation.

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE TOOLS:

1. TABLE OF CONTENTS (TOC)
- Automatically generated from heading styles
- Updates when you add new sections
- Clickable links for easy navigation
- Professional appearance for reports and proposals

2. FOOTNOTES VS. ENDNOTES
- Footnotes: Bottom of same page (quick references)
- Endnotes: End of document (detailed sources)
- Use Case: Footnotes for definitions, endnotes for full citations
- Auto-numbering prevents mistakes

3. CROSS-REFERENCES
- Link to figures, tables, or sections within document
- "See Figure 2 on page 15" - automatically updates!
- Prevents broken references when content moves
- Essential for technical documents

CITATION MASTERY:

4. CITATION STYLES
- APA: Psychology, Education, Sciences
- MLA: Literature, Humanities
- Chicago: History, Arts
- Choose based on your field or company preference

5. SOURCE MANAGEMENT
- Add sources as you research (don''t wait!)
- Include all required information
- Edit source details for accuracy
- Word remembers sources for future documents

6. BIBLIOGRAPHY GENERATION
- Automatic formatting based on style chosen
- Updates when you add new sources
- Properly formatted every time
- Saves hours of manual formatting!

GUIDED DOCUMENT PROJECT: Research Report Creation

You''ll create a structured research report with:
- Title page with proper formatting
