## üéØ Best Practices

### For Teachers
1. **Set Clear Instructions:** Provide detailed instructions in the quiz settings
2. **Reasonable Time Limits:** Allow 1-2 minutes per question
3. **Multiple Attempts:** Consider allowing 2-3 attempts for formative assessments
4. **Use Hints Wisely:** Add hints for complex questions to support learning
5. **Write Clear Explanations:** Help students learn from mistakes
6. **Review Analytics:** Use question difficulty data to improve future lessons

### For Students
1. **Read Carefully:** Use the "Read Aloud" feature if needed
2. **Use Hints:** Don't hesitate to view hints when stuck
3. **Flag Questions:** Mark difficult questions to review later
4. **Watch the Timer:** Pay attention to time warnings
5. **Review Feedback:** Read explanations to understand mistakes

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Admin API Limitation:** Analytics dashboard tries to load user data via `supabase.auth.admin.getUserById()` which may not work in all environments. Falls back to showing user IDs.

2. **Image Support:** Question images are supported in the schema but UI for uploading is not yet implemented.

3. **Manual Grading:** Short answer questions are auto-graded using exact match. Manual grading interface for essay-type questions is not implemented.

4. **Partial Credit:** Multiple select questions don't yet support partial credit (all-or-nothing scoring).

5. **Question Pool:** Random selection from question pools is not implemented (all questions shown).

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
None required - uses existing Supabase configuration.

### Database Migrations
All migrations created and ready to apply. Check `supabase/migrations/` for SQL files.
