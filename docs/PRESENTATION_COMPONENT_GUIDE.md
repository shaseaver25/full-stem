- **Allow Downloads** - Enable/disable download button (default: enabled)
- **Require Full Viewing** - Students must view all slides to complete (default: disabled)
- **Show Thumbnails** - Display thumbnail strip at bottom (default: enabled)

### Supported Platforms

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
<PresentationViewer
  title="Introduction to Biology"
  embedUrl="https://docs.google.com/presentation/..."
  slides={[]}
  speakerNotes="Review these concepts for the quiz"
  allowDownloads={true}
  requireFullViewing={false}
  showThumbnails={true}
  enableTranslation={true}
  onComplete={() => {}}
/>
```

### Integration with Existing Hooks
The component uses existing hooks from the codebase:
- `useTextToSpeech()` - For read-aloud functionality
- `useTranslation()` - For content translation
- Both hooks already support multiple languages and TTS engines

### Supported Languages
English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Italian, and 40+ more.

## Important: AI Lesson Creation

‚ö†Ô∏è **The Presentation component is NOT available in AI lesson creation mode.**

**Reason**: Large Language Models (including Gemini and GPT) cannot generate actual PowerPoint or slide files. They can only generate text content, outlines, and descriptions - not binary file formats like .pptx or visual slide decks.

**Current Implementation**:
- Presentation component only appears in **manual lesson builder mode**
- Teachers must manually upload or provide embed URLs for presentations
- AI lesson creation flow excludes this component type

**Future Considerations**:
If we integrate with a slides generation API (such as Canva's Presentation API), we could:
1. Have AI generate slide content (text, structure, bullet points)
2. Pass that content to Canva/similar API to create actual slides
3. Re-enable the Presentation component in AI lesson creation

Until then, teachers must create presentations separately and add them manually.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Embedded Presentation
```typescript
<PresentationViewer
  title="Week 1: Introduction"
  embedUrl="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abc123/embed"
/>
```

### With All Features Enabled
```typescript
<PresentationViewer
  title="Chapter 3: Cell Biology"
  embedUrl="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abc123/embed"
  speakerNotes="Pay special attention to slides 5-8 about mitosis"
  allowDownloads={true}
  requireFullViewing={true}
  showThumbnails={true}
  enableTranslation={true}
  onComplete={() => {
    console.log('Student completed presentation');
    markLessonComplete();
  }}
/>
```

### Restricted Viewing
```typescript
<PresentationViewer
  title="Test Material"
  embedUrl="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abc123/embed"
  allowDownloads={false}
  requireFullViewing={true}
  showThumbnails={false}
/>
```
