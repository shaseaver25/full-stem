2. Navigate to the **Developer Dashboard** and click on the **Sandbox** tab.
3. Locate the **Create Test Students** button in the "Test Student Accounts" section.
4. Click once ‚Äî wait for the success toast message:
   > ‚úÖ Test Students Created Successfully
5. Copy the credentials displayed in the modal (or check console logs).

### **Option 2 ‚Äì If the button is missing**
Open the browser console and run:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://irxzpsvzlihqitlicoql.supabase.co/functions/v1/create-test-students', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <your anon key>'
  }
});

console.table(data.credentials);
```

## üß≠ 1. Test Environment

- **Platform**: TailorEDU (staging build on Lovable)  
- **URL**: [https://lovable.dev/projects/6ba0ffd1-9a8e-49f9-9f63-94f86000b68b](https://lovable.dev/projects/6ba0ffd1-9a8e-49f9-9f63-94f86000b68b)  
- **Database**: Supabase (connected via TailorEDU instance)  
- **Testing Focus**: Adaptive learning experience, translation flow, accessibility, and clarity

---

## üß© 2. Core UX Testing Tasks  

### **A. Lesson Delivery**
- Verify lessons load clearly and identify goals up front.  
- Check font, color contrast, and readability (especially for dyslexia-friendly design).  
- Confirm lessons scale correctly on tablet and desktop.

### **B. Adaptive Flow**
- Complete one lesson per student profile.  
- Observe whether the next lesson's **difficulty, length, and vocabulary** change appropriately.  
- Confirm the change feels smooth (no abrupt reloads or content jumps).

### **C. Accessibility & Inclusivity**
- Activate text-to-speech; confirm word-by-word highlighting is synchronized.  
- Switch to Spanish profile (Mateo Rivera): confirm full translation, not partial.  
- Manually adjust reading level; ensure the interface reflows without errors.

### **D. Emotional/User Feedback**
- Note if students understand why lessons shift in difficulty.  
- Capture any moments of confusion, delay, or encouragement.  
- Evaluate tone and clarity of system messages ("Great job!", "Let's try again").

## üßæ 3. UX Tester Deliverables  

Each UX tester should submit:
1. **Screenshots or short screen recordings** (especially when lesson adapts).  
2. **One-paragraph reflection** per student (describe experience in their role).  
3. **Top 3‚Äì5 UX improvement ideas** ‚Äî focus on accessibility, flow, or clarity.  
4. (Optional) A Loom or short video walkthrough narrating findings.  

Attach deliverables directly in the Lovable document under:
- *Tester Notes*  
- *Error Log*  

---

## ‚úÖ 4. UX Focus Reminders  

- UX testing is about *experience quality*, not code debugging.  
- Focus on clarity, inclusivity, and response timing.  
- Don't skip accessibility: TTS, translation, and reading-level shift are central to TailorEDU's mission.  

---

## üîÑ 5. After Testing  

- Upload findings in the same Lovable doc: `QA Test Plan ‚Äì Part E`  
- Tag @DevLead and @Shannon for review.  
- Mark UX status: ‚úÖ "Pass", ‚ö†Ô∏è "Needs Refinement", or ‚ùå "Fail ‚Äì Major Flow Issue"
