# üõ°Ô∏è TailorEDU Security & Compliance Overview  
**Phase F: Security, Compliance & Data Integrity**

## **Purpose**
Before introducing predictive learning intelligence, this phase strengthens TailorEDU's protection of user data and ensures full compliance with educational privacy standards.

## **1. Current Gaps**
Derived from the latest Non-Working/Incomplete Features report:

| Category | Issue | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Authentication | 2FA disabled | ‚ùå |
| Access Control | No IP restrictions | ‚ùå |
| Compliance | FERPA/COPPA features missing | ‚ùå |
| Logging | Limited audit trails | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Data Retention | No automatic cleanup | ‚ùå |
| Backups | Incomplete automation | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Monitoring | No real-time metrics | ‚ö†Ô∏è |

---

## **2. Implementation Plan**

### **Phase F.1 ‚Äì Authentication & Access Control**
- Enable **two-factor authentication** for Admin and Developer roles.  
- Confirm **Row Level Security** on all class, student, and grading tables.  
- Apply **IP allow-listing** for Supabase and internal admin tools.  
- Add **session expiration** and re-authentication policies.

### **Phase F.2 ‚Äì Logging & Auditing**
- Expand `impersonation_logs` to capture all role-switch events.  
- Create table `security_audit_log` to track:  
  - Logins / failed attempts  
  - Password resets  
  - Role or permission changes  
  - File uploads or deletions  
- Add a read-only audit viewer to the Admin dashboard.

### **Phase F.3 ‚Äì Compliance Layer**
- Add FERPA & COPPA consent tracking for parent profiles.  
- Add "data deletion request" and "consent last reviewed" timestamps.  
- Implement one-click **export/delete** workflow for individual students.

### **Phase F.4 ‚Äì Backups & Monitoring**
- Schedule automated Supabase database + storage backups.  
- Integrate backup-status notifications to Admin dashboard.  
- Visualize `performance_metrics` for latency and uptime.  
- Add alerts for: failed backups, high latency, and repeated login failures.

## **3. Validation Checklist**

| Test | Expected Result | Verified |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Login without 2FA | Access blocked | ‚òê |
| Student cross-access attempt | Denied | ‚òê |
| Login recorded in `security_audit_log` | Success | ‚òê |
| Simulated backup failure | Alert triggered | ‚òê |
| Student record export | Complete JSON delivered | ‚òê |

---

## **4. Deliverables**
1. `SECURITY_OVERVIEW.md` ‚Äì this document (living roadmap).  
2. `SECURITY_TEST_PLAN.md` ‚Äì QA steps for all security features.  
3. Updated Supabase edge functions for:  
   - Audit logging  
   - Backup verification  
   - Data export/delete requests.

## **5. Notes**
Security implementation precedes predictive analytics and intelligence features.  
Once all boxes above are ‚úÖ verified, the system is cleared for **Phase G: Adaptive Intelligence Rollout**.
