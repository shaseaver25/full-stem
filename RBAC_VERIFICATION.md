# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Verification

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Frontend Protection
- Created `RequireRole` component for route protection
- Created `AccessDenied` (403) page with user-friendly messaging
- Protected all routes with role-based guards

### ✅ Backend Protection
- Strengthened RLS policies on all core tables
- Uses `has_role()` security definer function for safe permission checks
- Prevents privilege escalation and unauthorized data access

## Security Notes

### ⚠️ Remaining Security Warnings
The following security warnings are **pre-existing configuration issues** (not introduced by this RBAC implementation):

1. **Function Search Path Mutable** (4 warnings) - Some database functions need `SET search_path` added
2. **Auth OTP Long Expiry** - OTP tokens expire after too long
3. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled** - Should enable password leak detection
4. **Insufficient MFA Options** - Should enable more MFA methods
5. **Postgres Version** - Database should be upgraded for security patches

These should be addressed separately as they're platform configuration issues, not RBAC-specific problems.

### ✅ RBAC Security Features Implemented
- ✅ Role checks use server-side `user_roles` table (not client-side storage)
- ✅ RLS policies use security definer functions to prevent recursion
- ✅ Frontend route guards check roles from database
- ✅ Backend policies enforce data access at database level
- ✅ Access denied page doesn't leak information about what exists
- ✅ Roles are stored in separate table (not on user/profile tables)

- `src/pages/AccessDenied.tsx` - 403 error page
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated with RequireRole wrappers

### Database Migrations
- Migration file with strengthened RLS policies for:
  - teacher_profiles
  - parent_profiles
  - classes
  - grades
  - class_students
  - notifications
  - user_progress

### Utility Functions
