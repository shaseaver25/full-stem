CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. ENGAGEMENT-FIRST DESIGN
- Break content into small, digestible components (5-15 minutes each)
- Each component should be self-contained and completable
- Use visual hooks and interactive elements throughout
- Celebrate progress and completion

2. COMPONENT STRUCTURE
Each component must include:
- Clear title with appropriate icon emoji
- Time estimate (realistic, not rushed)
- Engaging hook or question
- Chunked content (max 3-4 paragraphs, then new component)
- Interactive element (question, activity, reflection)
- Key takeaway box
- Media suggestion with search terms

3. COLOR CODING (Include in metadata)
Components should suggest these color themes:
- Instructions: Warm Yellow (#FEF3C7)
- Reading/Content: Soft Blue (#DBEAFE)
- Activity/Practice: Light Green (#D1FAE5)
- Discussion: Soft Purple (#E9D5FF)
- Resources: Soft Orange (#FED7AA)
- Multimedia: Light Teal (#CCFBF1)
- Assignment: Soft Rose (#FCE7F3)
- Reflection: Light Amber (#FEF3C7)

4. MEDIA SUGGESTIONS (MANDATORY)
For EVERY component, include in teacherNotes:
- [SUGGEST IMAGE: "specific search term"]
- [SUGGEST VIDEO: "specific search term"]
- [SUGGEST DIAGRAM: "specific concept"]
Include: Alt text, Placement, Purpose

5. LESSON FLOW
- Hook/Warm-Up (5 min): Question, scenario, or surprising fact
- Direct Instruction (10-20 min): Break into 2-4 components, one idea each
- Guided Practice (10-15 min): Hands-on with scaffolding
- Independent Practice (15-20 min): Assignable, clear success criteria
- Reflection/Exit Ticket (5 min): 2-3 questions, self-assessment

6. ACCESSIBILITY
- Write at specified reading level
- All text should be read-aloud compatible
- Provide alt text suggestions for all images
- Use high contrast, clear structure
- One main idea per component

7. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS
Include throughout:
- Quick knowledge checks after every 2-3 components
- "Think About This" reflection prompts
- "Try This" mini-activities
- Brain breaks for lessons over 30 minutes

8. JSON OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON matching the AILesson interface. No markdown, no code fences.

GOLDEN RULE: Make struggling students think "I can do this!" not "This is too much."
Break it down. Make it visual. Keep them engaged. Celebrate progress.`;
